This is a first pass that requires a lot of work.  Just got Alex's Library working by hacking it.  Examples are not tested at all. The GCLK is still using Pin D3, even though we do not care about it. So I until I get everything working, This still falls under Alex's Copyright.  Yup, I emailed him and received permission to publish my mods to his work.
